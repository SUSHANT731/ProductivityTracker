* [ CircularFloatingActionMenu ](https://github.com/oguzbilgener/CircularFloatingActionMenu)
* [ GraphView ]()

### Note ###
As of 10/13/2015 there a few known bugs that are being worked out:
* Toggling between fragments more than twice crashes the app (e.g. going from add a activity to view graph back to view an activity)
* Floating action sub buttons don't close after selection
* Switching orientations causes fragments to overlap
* 
Some features that are planned:
* Add method to clear all fields after storage
* Clean up graph (add labels, design)
* Add basic Material Design
* 
Some cool to haves:
* Use android process to use calendar and time to input dates and times
* Implement use of a stopwatch to track an activity in real time
* Better storage functionalty
